Using a country-wide network for collection of plastic waste through rag pickers, waste collectors and waste dealers and recycling enterprises this plastic waste is collected and brought to the Sorting facilities for further processing.</li>
                            <li>This second step is the most crucial one as he actual plastic recycling process starts with Sorting. Sorting of different plastics occurs based. Sorting helps identify and eliminate contaminants. The process may employ manual methods or the use of specifically designed machines.</li>
                            <li>Once the recyclable plastics have been sorted, they go through the shredder. The shredder grinds and cuts the plastics into tiny pieces. After going through shredding, heavier and lighter plastics are separated using specially designed machines. This separation helps segregate different plastics.</li>
                            <li>The process of Sorting and Shredding ensures that the correct types of plastics are being processed and assorted together for further processing. After a complete separation, the flakes or chunks are then washed thoroughly with detergents to remove the remaining contamination.</li>
                            <li>Post drying, the plastic flakes are melted down under regulated temperatures. The regulation of temperatures ensures that the plastics are melted without getting destroyed. On melting, these plastics are extruded and resized to be processed in to granules which will later be compressed into pellets.</li>
                            <li>To enable the plastics to be reusable processed granules are compressed into tiny pellets. These pellets are also known as nurdles. Pellets also enables in storing similar types of plastics based on color, types of resin along with easy distribution.</li>
                            <li>It is important to note that, pellets recycled from particular types of plastics cannot to be re-used to make the same kinds of plastics. Instead they are re-purposed and redesigned in to other useful products.</li>
